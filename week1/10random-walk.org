* Random walks

For your homework today, you will explore *random walks* on your own.

** Build a biased coin

Create a new function ~biased_coin(p)~ which takes a probability $p
\in (0,1)$ that the coin flip is heads.

Build a ~biased_coin_experiment~ function akin to the previous
~coin_experiment~ and perform similar statistical calculations.

** Plot some random walks

Use the ~biased_coin~ function to define a 1-dimensional random
walk. That is, at each time step, the walker decides by the biased
coin flip whether to walk 'up' or 'down' along the $y$-axis.

Plot several random walks over long spans of time (say 1000 steps) for
various values of $p$.

What qualitative behavior do you observe?
