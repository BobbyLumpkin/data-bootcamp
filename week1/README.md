# Week 1

By the end of Week 1, you will know how to get into a Jupyter
notebook, wrangle and look at your data, estimate some feature of your
data, and to quantify how good your estimate is.  **In short, Week 1
prepares you to clean and prepare your data.**

## Day 1: Meet Jupyter and Python

Our first day is loaded with *many* more notebooks than usual.

To provide a consistent experience and to help us get into Python as
quickly as possible, we proceed by using Jupyter notebooks.  You
should already have received help setting up your Jupyter notebook
environment.  To practice, try opening the following notebook.

- [00jupyter](00jupyter.ipynb)

This course relies on Python.  I assume that you don't know Python,
but I know that you can learn very quickly, so you'll meet Python --
perhaps for the first time -- through a few notebooks:

- [01values](01values.ipynb)
- [02flow](02flow.ipynb)
- [03functions](03functions.ipynb)
- [04dictionaries](04dictionaries.ipynb)

Understanding data motivates our learning Python, so it will be
helpful to be able to load some data.

- [05files](05files.ipynb)

And when presented with data, the very first thing to do is to **look
at your data** so we meet `matplotlib` to put some tools in our
visualization toolkit.

- [06matplotlib](06matplotlib.ipynb)

In addition to workbooks that serve as lectures, each class day will
also provide exercises for you to work through.

- [07exercises](07exercises.ipynb)

## Day 2: Models and simulation

We meet first-class functions with a demo involving scipy.

- [08scipy](08scipy.ipynb)

We'll also practice running simulations by first simulating coin
tosses for a fair coin, meaning a coin equally likely to land on heads
as on tails.

- [09coins](09coins.ipynb)

Having had the experience, your homework is to implement a
`biased_coin` which will let you produce some graphs of random walks.

- [10random-walk](10random-walk.ipynb)

## Day 3: Linear regression in one variable

The simulations and visualizations encourage us to dig into various
techniques to summarize, like linear regression in one variable.

## Day 4: Estimates and bootstrapping

We "bootstrap" our way to some confidence intervals.
