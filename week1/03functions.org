#+TITLE: Functions
#+AUTHOR: Jim Fowler

"Programming" involves breaking down complicated problems into
simplier pieces.  "Functions" are one way of managing that complexity
by introducing some abstraction.

* Building your own functions

Use ~def~ to define a function, and call the function by appending ~()~ to its name.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython 
def greet():
    print('Hello, world!')

greet()
#+END_SRC

* Arguments

Your functions can take arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython 
def add_them(a, b):
    print(a,'plus',b,'is',a+b)

add_them(5,12)
#+END_SRC

* Documentation

The audience for the code you write is not only the machine, but
ultimately other people and your future self.  Some amount of
documentation is valuable in this regard, and "docstrings" can be nice
to make some "help" available for the new functions you define.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython 
def distance(a, b):
    """Determine the distance |a-b| between points a and b on the real line"""
    return abs(a-b)

print(help(distance))
#+END_SRC

* Return values

If we were thinking mathematically, a "function" ought to mean a
relationship between input and output.  We use ~return~ for this.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython 
def f(x):
    x = x + 1
    return x*x

f(5)
#+END_SRC

* Lambda

Not all students will want to think about ~lambda~, but for students
with some experience with programming, thinking about ~lambda~ can a
helpful next step.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython 
f = lambda x: x*x
f(5)
#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

* list comprehension

Python provides some syntactic sugar for building lists.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython 
[x**2 for x in range(10)]
#+END_SRC
